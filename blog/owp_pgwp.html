         <p><small> By <em>Dhruv Sharma</em> | Posted on: <em>01/11/2021</em></small></p>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          On 8 January 2021, the Government of Canada introduced a public <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2021/01/government-of-canada-announces-new-policy-to-help-former-international-students-live-in-work-in-and-continue-contributing-to-canada.html" target="_blank">policy</a> to help prior international students currently holding a post graduate work permit (PGWP), who may have been impacted by COVID19. According to this policy, the current post graduate work permit holders can apply for an open work permit that will be valid for another 18 months. This would provide the international student workers an opportunity to meet their work experience requirements to be eligible to apply for various permanent residence programs.
          <br></br>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h2> Eligibility to Apply </h2>
        In order to be eligible to apply for an open work permit under this policy, the applicant must:
        <ul>
          <li>have a PGWP that expired on or after January 30, 2020, or a PGWP that expires in 4 months or less from the date of application.</li>
          <li>Still be present in Canada</li>
          <li>Have a valid temporary status in Canada. Or be applying to restore their status (i.e. must meet eligibility to restore status).</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h2> How to apply </h2>
        The applications for work permit under this policy will open on January 27, 2021. That is when the applications instructions will be revealed.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h2>How international students impact Canadian Economy</h2>
        International students add over $21 billion annually to Canadian economy. They support numerous businesses, create new ones, and fulfill labour shortages. International students in Canada are well equipped to become highly contributing members of the Canadian society given their young age and strong Canadian education background.
        </p>

        <p>
        An interesting fact shared by IRCC : in 1971, there were 6.6 people of working age for each senior. However, given the current scenario, by 2035, there will be only 2 workers for every retiree. Without immigrants younger Canadians will end up paying more to take care of the aging population. Hence, immigration is important.
        <br></br>

        Stay tuned for more updates regarding this policy as application process is revealed by IRCC.
